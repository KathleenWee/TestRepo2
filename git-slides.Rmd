## Do you have all pre-requisites?

- Github account

- Git and Bash

- up to date R and Rstudio

If not, follow the setup instructions at
[asda.stat.ubc.ca/workshops/2016-04_ECOSCOPE_topics/setup.html](http://asda.stat.ubc.ca/workshops/2016-04_ECOSCOPE_topics/setup.html)

## How to track changes to your files

- nothing: live in the here and now

- date-stamped directories/files

- version control tools


## "Automating" version control

Version control tools:

- save the entire history of changes in the project

    - commented, time-stamped, author identified


## Benefits of version control

- easy to see what changed when, why, and by whom

- jump back to any point in time

- freedom to experiment

    - try out a crazy idea
    - can always go back to the last known good version
    - keep working on both in parallel

- manage contributions from multiple people


## Learning goals

- use Git version control tool in your projects

- collaborate more effectively with Github online service

    - manage simultaneous/conflicting changes by various contributors

    - use Github Issues for tracking TODOs and focus discussion


# Version control with Git


## What is Git?

- **a** version control system

- a **distributed** version control system

- originally developed to manage source code for Linux


## Why use Git and not _fill in the blank_?

- it is very fast, even for projects with hundreds of files and years
  of history

- doesn't require access to a server

- extremely popular, no strong reason to pick anything else (unless
  required)


## Before we start

Tell Git who you are:

In RStudio, go to "Tools" -> "Shell..." and enter:

```
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "me@email.com"
```


## Basic use

- create a new project

    - check "create a Git repository"

- see the "Git" tab

    - shows two files
    - status: "? ?"

- click in the "Staged" column

- commit


## Reviewing changes

- create a file Readme.md

- add and commit

- view history tab


## Terminology

Repository
: a store of contents and history of all files in a project

Commit
: a permanent snapshot of the state of the repository at a point in time

    - annotated with author, time, and comment
    - linked with a preceding ("parent") commit

Staging
: files marked for inclusion in the next commit

    - as they were _at the time they were staged!!_


## Exercise

1. Make more changes to Readme.md

2. Create a new file (R script or R/markdown document)

3. Add and commit


## Reviewing the history

- switch to the Git history view ("clock" icon in the Git tab)

- list of commits

- each shows what it changed ("diff")

- commit "name" (unique SHA-1 fingerprint)


## Undoing changes

If you:

- change your mind about your edits
- accidentally delete a file

Then:

- before committing:

    - right-click in Git tab and "Revert" to throw away
      the changes; or
      
    - in the "diff" view, click on "discard chunk" or "discard line"
    
- after committing: go back to a previous commit

    - must use shell: `git revert`


## Branching and merging

- use branches to test out new features without breaking the working
  code

    - must use shell: `git branch branch-name`

    - can switch branches in RStudio's Git tab

- when the work in a branch is done, merge it back into the main
  ("master") branch

    - must use shell: `git merge branch-name`


## Exercise

- create a new branch "develop"

- make some changes to the project (edit, delete, or create new files)

- add and commit

- switch to the "master" branch

- compare project contents

- merge the "develop" branch

- what happens?


## Merge conflicts

Git tries its best to merge changes from different branches, but
sometimes it fails ("merge conflict"):

- switch to the develop branch

- edit and commit

- switch to the master branch

- change the same lines and commit

- try to merge "develop"


## Resolving merge conflicts

- boths sets of conflicting lines are preserved in the file

    - look for markers `<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>`

- edit the file until it looks the way you want it (removing the
  markers)

- add and commit

- conflict solved!!


## Terminology

Branch
: a named sequence of commits kept separate

Merge
: including changes from one branch into another

Conflict
: parallel changes to same section(s) of a file that can't be
  automatically merged


# Collaboration with Git and Github

## What is Github?

- service that hosts your repository online

- web interface for Git

- features to help work with contributors/collaborators


## Why use Github and not _file in the blank_?

- nice graphical user interface for Git

- provides a copy of the repository that is easily accessed by others

- a variety of add-ons to facilitate collaboration

- *huge* community


## Github repository

- go to Github.com and sign-in

- click "Create a new repo"

- give it a name and description

- click "Create"


## Fork a repository

- view someone else's repository

- click "Fork"

- you get a copy of the repository under your account


## Issues

- bugs to fix

- features to add

- any "todo"

- mark who is responsible by "assigning"

- use "labels" for: milestones, type of todo, etc.


## Pull requests

- Github tracks differences between your fork and the original
  repository

- can request that changes be included in the original


## Exercise

Use the handout to work through the exercise. Work in pairs.


## Other Github goodies

- Wiki pages for documentation

- build a web site from a repo

- private repositories

- organizations
